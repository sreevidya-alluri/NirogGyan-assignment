# 🏥 Hospital Management Frontend (Mock)

This is a mock frontend application built to showcase a basic **Hospital Management System** UI. The project is implemented using **TypeScript** and **Bootstrap** and utilizes **mock data** to demonstrate listing of doctors and patients.

---

## 🚀 Tools / Libraries Used

- **TypeScript** – Type-safe JavaScript development for better maintainability.
- **Bootstrap 5** – For responsive UI components and styling.
- **HTML5 & DOM APIs** – For basic structure and interaction.
- **Axios** (planned) – Intended for future backend integration with REST APIs.

## 💡 Improvements with More Time

Given additional time and resources, the following enhancements could be implemented:

- 🔗 **Backend Integration**: Replace mock data with dynamic content fetched from a Node.js + Express + MySQL backend.
- ➕ **Add & Edit Forms**: Add functionality to create or update doctor/patient records via forms.
- 🧾 **Search & Filter**: Add ability to search/filter doctors or patients based on specialization or condition.
- 🧑‍💼 **Authentication**: Implement login flow for hospital staff using sessions or JWT.
- 📱 **Mobile Optimization**: Fine-tune the layout for smaller screens and improve accessibility.

## 🧠 Challenges Faced and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| ⚠️ Structuring TypeScript with Bootstrap | Manually configured TypeScript to work with DOM manipulation and Bootstrap 5 classes without relying on a framework like React. |
| 💾 No real backend available | Used mock JSON objects to simulate realistic hospital data (doctors, patients) to focus on frontend logic and UI/UX. |
| 🎯 Clean state updates | Ensured that DOM elements (lists) are updated cleanly by clearing previous content before re-rendering, preventing duplicates. |
